\title{Calculating weights for treatment and control group under non-random attrition}
\usage{
calculateWeights(Y, D, X, Z, method = "glm")
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric vector of outcome variable. Non-response should be coded as NA.}

\item{D}{Numeric vector of treatment indicators.}

\item{X}{Numeric vector of observed covariates.}

\item{Z}{Numeric vector of instrumental variable.}

\item{method}{String indicating method of probability estimation. Can be glm or gam.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the product of the response propensity score and treatment propensity score 
 \item{Y}{An object of responses which may or may not include NA}
 \item{D}{A numeric vector (binary; treatment = 1, contro = 0)} 
 \item{X}{A numeric vector of observed covariates}
 \item{Z}{A numeric vector of instrumental variable}
 \item{method}{A string indicating the method of probability estimation}
}
\description{
\code{calculateWeights} estimates the weights for treatment and control group 
in order to obtain internally and externally valid estimates for the average treatment
effect in cases of attrition.
}
\details{
The function estimates the response propensity score and the treatment 
propensity score to reweigh the observations and correct for attrition. 
The response propensity score is defined as $p(W) = Pr(R=1 | \code{X},
\code{D}, \code{Z})$ where $R$ denotes to the binary response variable 
being 1 if \code{Y} is observed and 0 otherwise (attrition), and the treatment
propensity score, defined as $\pi(\code{X}, p(W)) = Pr(\code{D}=1 | \code{X}, p(W), R=1)$.
Response and treatment propensity scores are multiplied for treatment and control group
in order to adjust for differences in the distributions of X and p(W) between 
treated and nontreated respondents. For more information on the method, 
see Huber (2012) below.
