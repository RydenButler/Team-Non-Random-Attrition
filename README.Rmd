# attritR - Estimating Treatment Effects Under Conditions of Non-Random Attrition

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

attritR is a statistical package that uses inverse probability weighting to estimate treatment effects under non-random attrition due to treatment, observable confounding, and unobservable confounding. It implements the method derived by Martin Huber in "Identification of Average Treatment Effects in Social Experiments Under Alternative Forms of Attrition" (Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, vol. 37, no. 3, 443-474; 2012).
